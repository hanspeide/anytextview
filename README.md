## AnyTextView

> Note: AnyTextView is no longer being maintained. I recommend replacing AnyTextView with the [Calligraphy library](https://github.com/chrisjenx/Calligraphy) instead.

Frustration arise the moment you realise that you cannot set a custom font on TextView, EditText and Button views using the ```android:typeface``` XML-attribute. AnyTextView is here to relieve your pain.

### Setup
If you're using Gradle (recommended), add the following to your build.gradle file:
```javascript
dependencies {
    compile 'com.ctrlplusz.anytextview:library:1.2'
}
```

If you're using Maven, add the following to your pom.xml file:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.ctrlplusz.anytextview</groupId>
  <artifactId>library</artifactId>
  <version>1.2</version>
  <type>aar</type>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively, [download the .aar][1] and reference it from your project.

### How to use:
1) Copy the fonts you want to use into the _assets/fonts_ folder of your project

2) Add your application namespace to the root element in the XML file that is to contain AnyTextView's, e.g
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ScrollView
        xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        xmlns:foobar="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
		.. >
```  

3) Instead of using
```xml
<TextView ../>

<!-- ... or ... -->

<EditText ../>

<!-- ... or ... -->

<Button ../>
```

use

```xml
<com.ctrlplusz.anytextview.AnyTextView 
	foobar:typeface="FontFileName.ttf" ..> <!-- Where "foobar" is the namespace defined in step 2 -->

<!-- ... or ... -->

<com.ctrlplusz.anytextview.AnyEditTextView 
	foobar:typeface="FontFileName.ttf" ..> 
	
<!-- ... or ... -->

<com.ctrlplusz.anytextview.AnyButton 
	foobar:typeface="FontFileName.ttf" ..> 
```  

 
4) Profit!
